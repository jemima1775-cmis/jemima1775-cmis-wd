				Lists and Links
			</h2>
			<p>
				This assignment was to learn to use lists and links. We had to use the lists part of html to create a list of instructions and directions. We also had to use the links elements to link to other webpages, but also to other pages on our own websites.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Create a new folder called "listsandlinks" in your repository folder.
				</li>
				<li>
					Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css"
				</li>
				<li>
					In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage on the production server.
				</li>
				<li>
					Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link back to your main index page.
				</li>
				<li>
					In your main index.html file in public_html, add an unordered list of links to the nav section with a link to "listsandlinks".
				</li>
				<li>
					In your old index.html, add an article with a heading and a paragraph description of this assignment. Also add an unordered list that contains this list of requirements. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Turn in your work.

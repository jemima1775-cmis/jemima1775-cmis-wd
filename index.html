			<h2>  
				Welcome to my site!
			</h2>
			<p> 
				This website will contain projects completed for the Web Design part of Computer Science 1 at CMIS.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Lists and Links
			</h2>
			<p>
				This assignment was to learn to use lists and links. We had to use the lists part of html to create a list of instructions and directions. We also had to use the links elements to link to other webpages, but also to other pages on our own websites.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Create a new folder called "listsandlinks" in your repository folder.
				</li>
				<li>
					Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css"
				</li>
				<li>
					In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage on the production server.
				</li>
				<li>
					Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link back to your main index page.
				</li>
				<li>
					In your main index.html file in public_html, add an unordered list of links to the nav section with a link to "listsandlinks".
				</li>
				<li>
					In your old index.html, add an article with a heading and a paragraph description of this assignment. Also add an unordered list that contains this list of requirements. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Turn in your work. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				Tables
			</h2>
			<p>
				In this section, we needed to create tables. We used many different aspects of tables including, thead, tbody and tfoot. We also used the rowspan and colspan attribute.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Create a new folder in your repository called "tables"
				</li>
				<li>
					In the "tables" folder, create a new file called from your template "index.html"
				</li>
				<li>
					Be sure to use thead, tbody, and tfoot elements in your tables.
				</li>
				<li>
					Add html code to recreate the webpage below.
				</li>
				<li>
					second table will require the use of the colspan attribute.
				</li>
				<li>
					third table will require the use of the rowspan attribute.
				</li>
				<li>
					In your repository index.html file, add an article with a heading, paragraph description and this list of requirements. Also add a link to the tables/index.html file. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Add a link from lists and links to this assignment as well
				</li>
				<li>
					Validate your code.
				</li>
				<li>
					Turn it in.
				</li>
			</ul>
